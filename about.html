              <h4 style="color: #008000;">History - DUAC</h4>
              <p style="color: #008000;">
                The Delhi Urban Art Commission was set up by an Act of Parliament in 1973 to "advise the Government of
                India in the matter of preserving, developing and maintaining the aesthetic quality of urban and
                environmental design within Delhi and to provide advice and guidance to any local body in respect of any
                project of building operations or engineering operations or any development proposal which affects or is
                likely to affect the skyline or the aesthetic quality of the surroundings or any public amenity provided
                therein" The area of urban Delhi has expanded and it has become more densely built in the years since
                the DUAC was constituted. This gives even greater relevance to the injunctions in the original mandate.
                Ecology and heritage are more pressing concerns now, the difficulties of seeing the city as a whole in a
                situation where there are many decision-making bodies are more evident than before, and there is an urgent
                need to have a vision for the future of the city's constituent elements.
              </p>
              <h4 style="color: #008000;">Main Concerns</h4>
              <p style="color: #008000;">
                If in the 1970s the predominant concern was about uncontrolled high-rise development, in the 1980s
                issues linked with Asian Games in the 1990s the building of Dwarka and the freezing of the New Delhi
                Bungalow area, this decade's main concerns are about four issues - the threats to the remaining oases of
                open spaces, riverine and forest, the need to improve the quality of life in historic precincts, the
                need to ensure that dilapidated areas are 'redeveloped' elegantly, and to find ways in which traffic
                networks can work efficiently but with a humane quality. The DUAC took significant initiative to
                highlight city-level issues in an exhibition ‘Imagining Delhi’.
              </p>
              <h4 style="color: #008000;">Major Activities</h4>
              <p style="color: #008000;">
                The major activities of the Commission ranged over many issues. The new Metro lines and the
                Commonwealth Games projects, and extensions to existing institutions, were examined in the context of
                the underlying ecology and of historic neighborhoods. Agencies with overlapping jurisdiction were
                invited to discussions for norms about street furniture, and (with the cooperation of the NCT
                Government) to identify ways to 'improve' Shahjahanabad. Pilot projects initiated by DUAC, to serve as
                templates, include the proposals on Khirkee Village and on Sunheri Bagh, and the work on a Zonal
                Development Plan for the NDMC. Much time and thought has been given to the pressing issues of modifying
                and adding to transport-corridors. The Commission has been organizing workshops from time to time on
                important issues concerning the Capital City. To draw attention of all concerned to hazards involved in
                the issue of additions to existing inhabited multistoried housing projects, the Commission organized a
                workshop in March 09. With a view to promoting work of Art as an integral part of public projects,
                particularly at the Commonwealth Games Venues, the Commission organized another workshop on 11.4.09. The
                Commission took the opportunity of the Commonwealth Games to showcase Delhi to the visitors to the City
                as well as its citizens through an exhibition called 'Delhinama'. The biography of this fascinating city
                unfolded through over a year of intense research work by a group of scholars, professionals, and crafts
                people. Layer by layer the team unearthed amazing continuities hidden in the folds of time, of this
                throbbing contemporary megapolis. In this effort, the Commission also received the active assistance of a
                number of national and international institutions as well as support of the Government of India and the
                Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.
